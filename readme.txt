Subtract 2.0
------------

This program subtracts a number from another one.

With this version comes a full user interaction so the program does not have to be run with a debugger anymore as the previous versions.

Just invoke the program after compilation.

Then the program asks you for the first number (the number from which is subtracted)

After that the program asks for the second number (which will be subtracted)

After the calculation the program shows the result on the screen and terminates.

An example for

  8 - 6 = 2
  
looks like this:

  in : 8
  in : 6
  out: 2.000000
