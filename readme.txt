Subtract 1.0

This program subtracts a number from another one.

The subtraction and the result have to be investigated with using a debugger.

1  double a,b,c;
2
3  main()
4  {
5    c=a-b;
6  }

Set a breakpoint to line 3 or 4 and start the program execution.

Then set another breakpoint on line 6.

Then set the variable

  a
  
with the number from which should be subtracted.

Then set the variable

  b
  
with the number that should be subtracted from the number in variable a.

Then let the program run.

Investigate the content of variable

  c
  
to see the result.

Finally continue the program execution to finish the program.
